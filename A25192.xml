            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The following MAXIMS were found amongſt the Papers of the Great <hi>Almanzor;</hi> and tho they muſt loſe a good deal of their Original Spirit by the Tranſlation, yet they ſeem to be ſo Applicable to all Times, that it is thought no Diſſervice to make them Publick.</head>
            <list>
               <item>I. THAT a Prince who falleth out with his Laws, breaketh with his Beſt Friends.</item>
               <item>II. That his Exalting his own Authority above his Laws, is like his letting in an Enemy to ſurprize his Guards. The Laws are the only Guards he can be ſure will never run away from him.</item>
               <item>III. A Prince that will ſay, He can do no good, except he may do every thing; teacheth his People to ſay, They are Slaves if they may not do what they have a mind to.</item>
               <item>IV. That Power and Liberty are like Heat and Moiſture; where they are mixt, every thing proſpers; where they are ſingle, they are deſtructive.</item>
               <item>V. That Arbitrary Power is like moſt other things that are very hard, they are alſo very apt to break.</item>
               <item>VI. That the Profit of Places ſhould be meaſured, as are more or leſs conducing to the Publick Service; and if Buſineſs is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than Splendor, the Inſtruments of it ought in proportion to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paid: That the contrary method is as impertinent, as it would be to let the Carving of a Ship coſt more than all the reſt of it.</item>
               <item>VII. That where the leaſt uſeful part of the People, have the moſt Credit with the Prince, men will conclude, That the way to get eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, is to be good for nothing.</item>
               <item>VIII. That an extravagant Gift to any one man, raiſeth the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to every body elſe; ſo that in conſequence, The Unlimited Bounty of an Unthinking Prince, maketh him a Beggar, let him have never ſo much Money.</item>
               <item>IX. That if ordinary Beggars are whipp'd, the daily Beggars in fine Cloaths, out of a proportionable reſpect to their Quality, ought to be hanged.</item>
               <item>X. That Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want, and a great deal more Sawcy.</item>
               <item>XI. That a Prince who will give more to Importunity, than to Merit, had as good ſet out a Proclamation to all his loving Subjects, forbidding them to ſerve well, upon peril of being undone by it.</item>
               <item>XII. That a Wiſe Prince will not oblige his Courtiers, who are Birds of Prey, ſo as to diſoblige his People, who are Beaſts of Burthen.</item>
               <item>XIII. That it is ſafer for a Prince to Judge of men by what they do to one another, than by what they do to him.</item>
               <item>XIV. That it is a groſs miſtake, That a Knave betwixt man and man, can be honeſt to a King, whom of all others men generally make the leaſt ſcruple to deceive.</item>
               <item>XV. That a Prince who can ever truſt the man that hath once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, loſeth the Right of being faithfully dealt with by any body elſe.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47994:2"/>
XVI. That it's not poſſible to find out ſuch an honeſt Knave, as will let no body elſe Cheat him.</item>
               <item>XVII. That if a Prince doth not ſhew an Averſion to Knaves, there will be Inference that will be Natural, let it be never ſo Unmanerly.</item>
               <item>XVIII. That a Prince who formeth his Opinion too ſoon, will be in danger of repenting it too late.</item>
               <item>XIX. That it is leſs dangerous for a Prince to mind too much what the People ſay, than too little.</item>
               <item>XX. That a Prince is to take care, the greater part of the People may not be angry at the ſame time; for tho the firſt beginnings of their Ill Humours ſhould be againſt one another, yet if not ſtopped, it will naturally end in Anger againſt him.</item>
               <item>XXI. That if Princes would reflect how much they are in the Power of their Miniſters, they would be more circumſpect in the Choice of them.</item>
               <item>XXII. That a Wiſe Prince will ſupport Good Servants againſt mens Anger, and not ſupport Ill ones againſt their Complaints.</item>
               <item>XXIII. That Parties in a State generally, like Free-booters, hang out falſe Colours; the pretence is, The Publick Good; the real buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, To catch Prizes; like <hi>Tartars,</hi> whenever they ſucceed, inſtead of improving their Victory, they forceably fall upon the Baggage.</item>
               <item>XXIV. That a Prince may play ſo long between two Parties, that they may in time join together to be in earneſt with him.</item>
               <item>XXV. That there is more dignity in open Violence, than in the Unskilful Cunning of a Prince, who goes about to impoſe upon the People.</item>
               <item>XXVI. That the People will ever ſuſpect the Remedies for the Diſeaſes of the State, where they are wholly excluded from ſeeing how they are prepared.</item>
               <item>XXVII. That changing Hands without changing Meaſures, is as if a Drunkard in a Dropſy ſhould change his Doctor, and not his Diet.</item>
               <item>XXVIII. A Prince is to watch that his Reaſon may not be ſubdued to his Nature; ſo as not to be ſo much a Man of Peace as to be a Jeſt in an Army, nor ſo much a Man of War, as to be out of his Element in the Council.</item>
               <item>XXIX. That a man who cannot mind his own buſineſs, is never to be truſted with the King's</item>
               <item>XXX. That Quality alone ſhould only ſeem to make a ſhew in the Embroider'd Part of the Government; but that Ignorance, tho never ſo well born, ſhould never be admitted to ſpoil the Publick Buſineſs.</item>
               <item>XXXI. That he who thinketh his Place below him, will mind it ſo little, that he will certainly be below his Place.</item>
               <item>XXXII. That when the Prince's Example ceaſeth to have the Force of a Law, it is a ſure ſign that his Power is waſting, and there will be but little difference between mens neglecting to Imitate, and their refuſing to Obey.</item>
               <item>XXXIII. That a People may let a King fall, and yet ſtill remain a People, but if a King lets his People ſlip from him, he is no more a King.</item>
